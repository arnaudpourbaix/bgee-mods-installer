# bgee-mods-installer

Automated mods install.
This is my own mod manager, without any UI, just command line tools.

It is designed to install a full mod list in one shot, by copying all mods from a network hard drive (and later on from git directory).
It can parse WeiDU.log to run a full installation.

## Compatibility
